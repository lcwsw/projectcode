5.0 out of 5 stars,GREAT FOR FACETIME CALLS,I was having some issues with my FaceTime calls with a doctor who already had some hearing loss and this item totally fixed the problem. This is a cool design that at first seems like it may be far less perfect for zoom and FaceTime calls that have become exponentially more common after the pandemic changed everything including the telehealth system that was also fully expanded into the methods of all companies and motif for replacing group meetings and voice group phone reach with the FaceTime and Zoom digital visual meetings that are now endemic in a very short period of time. This time was so terrible for countless people and the need for a device like this cool functioning low priced and ‘I can attest to the niche that was able to solve my very basic issues with the microphone on my iPhone being amazing but also vulnerable to just the ultra small hole that is often partially producing different levels of clear communication. But the simple genius of this puppy has a seemingly too basic stand that is on the base of the device. This base is also a Bluetooth speaker and has its own microphone that allows the iPhone to use a microphone other than the one on the phone and the speaker that amplifies the conversation with the Bluetooth speakers. I have given all my girls this great gift that is realized after using it for the video meetings that were at times made into a less fully integrated and inclusive work around that doesn’t have to be built into the phone but rather using this portable and powerful bauhaus type of design that is the answer for a percentage of users and the dependence upon the brilliant iPhone and smartphone placement and the way that different people talk into their phones with the knowledge of this speaking with the phone tilted and the microphone location at the bottom of the screen. This is the reality of a world of people who use their phones with endless differences which are also the reason why my iPhone and my knowledge being enough. So without trying to philosophize about microphones and iPhones; this addiction is made powerful by the Bluetooth speaker not being mainly for music and not the super smart solution for me and my upset doctor who hadn’t found this and purchased a seemingly unneeded accessory. If you are making zoom calls and being part of FaceTime and zoom now common for the world after the spaces between us were mandated by a pat of evolution and introduction into the devastation building walls in life and the fact that our smartphones are essential and yet the never ending accessories that exist for making the smartphone and the smart designs still not able to fix situations by upgrading the system when it’s a truly basic geometric and the good fact that we all can use our phones with our own style and with or without the schematics to be hit with a world that had not become video callers due to a world event and not the desire to let this old school belief that the future would prefer video calls instead of the mobile calling made on the absolute most incredible invention of the century and the fact that just a few years back… these devices didn’t show up on the most high tech views of the iPhone becoming the tricorder that Spock carried in Star Trek being the one exception to the bitmap text on huge computer screens without predicting the truth and now the scenes are like flaws that were in the science fiction predictions. Sorry for the preaching with text and not even having to use this affordable and valuable thing making the high tech brilliance to be brilliant.,5 stars,5 stars. GREAT FOR FACETIME CALLS.

4.0 out of 5 stars,A good amplifier for the hard of hearing,"The Jteman phone amplifier works well. Operation is simple and so far reliable. I am hard of hearing and so this amplifier helps significantly to improve my hearing of phone conversations. The maximum volute level is fairly good. It works for me. I have not tried this with several people on my end participating in the call, but I am confident that it will do the job adequately.

I would say that the build quality if about the same as with most electronics made in China . It seems to be sturdy and well made.

The phone stand is adjustable for the angle you wish. It is simply a holder for your phone. You can set your phone of almost any size and shape on the stand. The phone can be in either a horizontal position or vertical position. The base of the holder folds up into the unit so that the back portion can be folded down against the speaker.

The self contained rechargeable batteries are charged using a USB-C connector, so any USB charger with a ""C"" type connector on one end of the cable will work. The proper cable is provided with the amplifier.

If I were to fault this phone amplifier, I think there are two things I would mention. The first is that the clarity of the speaker is somewhat mellow, so that higher frequencies are lost to a degree. I find this to be the major fault for me with my hearing loss. I would like a crisper tone designed to give clear voice amplification as that is what I primarily use this amplifier for.

The second criticism I have for this amplifier which is really nit picking, but could have easily been eliminated with a minimal design change. The power/charging/bluetooth LED is hidden from view when the unit is folded up for storage or charging. You have to lift the phone holder out of the storage position in order to view this LED.

Once setup, when you press the POWER button, you will get a audio message ""POWER ON"", ""BLUETOOTH MOUNT"" and ""CONNECTED"". This process will take about 3 to 5 seconds. You will need to hold the POWER button down several seconds for this to happen. To power off, a simple press of the POWER button will turn the unit off with the message ""POWER OFF"".

I found the instructions relatively clear and I had no difficulty in getting the phone amplifier to connect via bluetooth to my Samsung Android phone.

When receiving a phone call, your phone will ring and after a second or two, the phone amplifier will connect with the call. To accept a call, you press the ""Phone/Fast Forward"" button. To disconnect to the call, you press the same button again. Be careful not to double click this button as that will hang up the call.

I have not tried other phone amplifiers, so for the moment,the Jteman seems to be a good choice.",4 stars,"4 stars. A good amplifier for the hard of hearing. The Jteman phone amplifier works well.

4.0 out of 5 stars,Simple Speaker Stand,"This Bluetooth stand is actually better than I thought it would be!

I will admit, I was skeptical about how nice this could be, but the stand is extremely sturdy. You can angle it to your needs and it stays in place without worry. I haven’t tried it myself, but it seems like if it is angled a certain way you might even be able to use it for tablets.
The stand holder is wide enough for a phone with a somewhat thin case, but not sure how it would hold up if you have a thick or extremely protective case. It may not be able to fit them, but I have a thin case myself so I am not sure how it would do. There’s also an opening in the middle so you can hook your phone charger to it with ease when vertical, though it can hold your phone horizontally just fine as well.
The speaker itself has good volumes overall for its purposes. Not as much a speaker for big parties and whatnot, but great if you are working at your desk with it or using it for various helpful things like in the kitchen for recipes or so forth. For individual use, it’s great.

I do have two minor negatives that made me drop the rating by a star. First, there’s something small and loose inside it that rattles when moves and shaken. I tend to try and not do that to my stuff much, but it reminds me of a maraca with even just one tiny piece in there loose.
My second negative is that it doesn’t seem to fully close when I close it back up. I’m not sure if that’s the design or something else, but it slightly sticks up from being all the way in place. It’s not a huge issue as it still is closed fine, but it is a bit annoying.

Overall, this speaker stand is pretty nice. While mine did come with two minor flaws, the positive uses and features it has far outweigh the negative by making it functional and a neat little gadget. I recommend this to anyone needing a personal speaker with relatively lower sound levels, as this stand and speaker are great for the job.",4 stars,"4 stars. Simple Speaker Stand.

1.0 out of 5 stars,TOTAL TRASH and $7.99 to return it!!!!!!!,"PROS
1. Connecting the Bluetooth was easy and the name of the Bluetooth is on the bottom.
2. It has a cell phone holder.

CONS
1. I bought this to listen to YouTube documentaries while in the shower. The counter is three feet from the shower and I can actually hear my iPhone better than this trash!!!!
2. It doesn’t come with a power source, and I don’t even have the old USB power blocks anymore because the world has moved on to USB-C as it charges faster than the old style USB. So I had to buy one which makes this not as cheap as advertised since nowhere in the marketing photos do they bother to show the charging cable which is USB-C > USB. So make sure you buy one when you order this.
3. They put the USB-C charging port on the right side of the unit instead of the back so it takes up way more space than it needs to due to poor design.
4. They charge you $7.99 to return it!!!!

I guess you get what you pay for plus a lot of return headaches.",1 stars,"1 stars. TOTAL TRASH and $7.99 to return it!!!!!!!. PROS

I accidentally left it outside and it got rained on. I took the thing apart to dry it out and discovered a microphone on the circuit board.
Since this Bluetooth device that connects to your smartphone has no (obvious) functionality that requires a microphone, the only reason for it is to listen to you without your knowledge. I removed the microphone and it still ""works"" despite having been full of water, but I'm not going to use it because I have no idea who it's communicating with through my phone and what it's communicating to ""them"".

1.0 out of 5 stars,Defective audio issue,"I got this as a Christmas gift. I'm hard of hearing, so I was happy to get it.

The device was 80% charged, so we tried it right away.

Receive-side audio was fine. Clear. Music replay quality was fair to medium, most Bluetooth speakers are better, but it was usable for podcasts, not great for music. No tone settings, but they're built into my phone.

The caller (transmit) side audio was simply horrible. In a word, unbearable. Choppy, breaking apart with every other word. Keep in mind we were testing it inside with a strong Wifi6 mesh network that we use daily.

Defective, unusable, so disappointing. I was looking forward to making Christmas calls with this. Instead, I had to pack it up for return shipment.

I'm a retired ISO 9000 certified Quality Auditor. There's definitely some quality issues with this product that the mfgr needs to fix.",1 stars,"1 stars. Defective audio issue. I got this as a Christmas gift. I'm hard of hearing, so I was happy to get it.
