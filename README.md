# Individual Project

The codebase includes the preprocessing code, code of using the models and further analysis codes.  
They are also uploaded under the notebooks.

# Procedures

## Perfrom Preprocessing:  
Original reviews extracted:    
- [Amazon_Product_Review_B08GC1G4Y9](data/Amazon_Product_Review_B08GC1G4Y9.csv)   
  
Preprocessing code:  
- [Preprocessing Code](markdowns/Prepocessing%20my%20data%20(Final).md)

A preprocessed file will be created.  
- [Preprocessed Data](data/preprocessed_data_veryless.csv)   

  
## Using the models:   
  
Applying four models on the preprocessed data:  
- [Using the Models](markdowns/Using%20the%20models%20(Final).md)

    
4 csv files is created:  
- [1st Sentiment Analysis](data/1_sentiment_analysis_results_processed_less.csv)
- [2nd Sentiment Analysis](data/2_bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment_processed_less.csv)
- [3rd Sentiment Analysis](data/3_lxyuan_distilbert_processed_less.csv)
- [4th Sentiment Analysis](data/4_sohan_ai_sentiment_analysis_processed_less.csv)

  
## Further analysis on the sentiment analysis result:  
1. Calulating the average and counting the label.  

- [1st Analysis Result](data/1_analysis_result.csv)
- [2nd Analysis Result](data/2_analysis_result.csv)
- [3rd Analysis Result](data/3_analysis_result.csv)
- [4th Analysis Result](data/4_analysis_result.csv)  
  
2. Counting the frequently used keywords and phrases:  
- [Further analysis on the 1st model](markdowns/Further%20analysis%20on%20the%201st%20model.md)
- [Further analysis on the 2nd model](markdowns/Further%20analysis%20on%20the%202nd%20model.md)
- [Further analysis on the 3rd model](markdowns/Further%20analysis%20on%20the%203rd%20model.md)
- [Further analysis on the 4th model](markdowns/Further%20analysis%20on%20the%204th%20model.md)
